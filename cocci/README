lock, isnull and free should be usable

Apr 4: null_ref should be usable

Apr 5: noderef.cocci is a minimal attempt at finding allocations with the
wrong side argument.  This semantic patch should be run without any options.

realloc looks usable, but perhaps the python has to be adjusted?
-no_includes -include_headers

Apr 6: null_ref is correlated but has run without option.

-----------------

get.cocci and copy.cocci are both Engler's "Range" (check bounds derived
from user data).  They give very few results for linux-next, perhaps
because they are not clever enough or perhaps because the bugs like this
have been fixed.  get refers to get-user and copy refers to copy_from_user.
A man page for get_user from 1999 says that these functions were introduced
in Linux 2.1.2.  The change is as follows.

x = get_user(addr) => err = get_user(x,addr);
put_user(x,addr) => err = put_user(x,addr);
memcpy_fromfs(...) => bytes_left = copy_from_user(...);
memcpy_tofs(...) => bytes_left = copy_to_user(...);
