*=*=*=* Project to study faults in Linux *=*=*=*

This project study Linux version based on linux-* tags available
in the git repository mentioned in study.hc.base.

The 'master' branch keeps track of the project definitions.
Which coccinelle files are applied? Which options are used?...

The 'orig.org' branch tracks the results of Coccinelle for each
spatch file and each Linux version. The *.orig.org files are stored
under results/linux/linux-*/.

The 'correl' branch tracks the correlation files and the correlated files.

A correlated file lists the unique reports with a status annotation
as a Org headline. The status are the following:
- TODO: Not manually reviewed
- UNKNOWN: Not able to determine
- FP: False Positive report from coccinelle
- BUG: Fault report.

For each report, the list of Linux version affected is given
as subitems of the headline.
