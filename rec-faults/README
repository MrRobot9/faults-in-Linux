In 1st-collect, the recursive iteration are done.
The iterate process is control by the herodotos
infrastructure and applied on all the versions.

The output is placed in the acc_* files.
These files are further processed by the fix
tool (fix.ml) to produce files for the 2nd-find-faults
directory.


Once herodotos and make have been used to produce
the acc_* files, the 'apply-fix' target can be used
to automatically apply the fix and copy the files
in the 2nd-find-faults directory.

NOTE:
	null2 is identical to null3.
	null2 is used for mini-osdi,
	while null3 is used for linux-2.6
	but herodotos may have been used
	to handle that difference.
